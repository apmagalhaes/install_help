It assumes that you have a clean, working installation of OS X 10.11 El Capitan already installed. If you prefer to start with a clean hard drive and reinstall OS X, follow the steps under Installing OS X below; otherwise, skip ahead to Installing Windows 8.1.\n\n\nThis protocol was successful as of Sept. 13, 2016 and was performed on a 15\" 2015 MacBook Pro with Intel i7 processor, 16 GB RAM, and a 1 Terabyte hard drive. In theory, this procedure should work on any Apple computer capable of running El Capitan.\n\n\ntl;dr?\n\n\nThe basic steps are as follows (see below for details):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom OS X, install Windows 8 via Boot Camp, providing only the disk space you need for Windows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeactivate Core Storage on the primary OS X partition (so that it can be resized).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResize the primary OS X partition, leaving empty space between it and your Windows (i.e. BOOTCAMP partition).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall Ubuntu on (part of) the newly created empty space.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse GPT fdisk to change the master boot record (MBR) from hybrid (which the Ubuntu installation inevitably creates) to protective; otherwise, Windows will fail to boot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn OS X, format the remaining disk space (if any) as FAT for shared data storage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange the primary user's UID in Ubuntu such that the shared FAT data partition is readable and writable across all three operating systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn OS X, install rEFInd to enable operating system selection at boot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequired:\n\n\n\n\n\n\na stable Internet connection, preferably wired. Apple's USB Ethernet adapter was recognized by all 3 operating systems and worked reliably during setup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\na downloaded \n.iso\n file of Windows 8.1 (does not require its own dedicated thumb drive or partition).\n\n\n\n\n\n\na dedicated Ubuntu 14.04 installation USB stick. Instructions for making one can be found \nhere\n (follow instructions under Manual Approach).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nadministrator privileges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsufficient disk space for each OS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nabout 1.5 hours to get everything installed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\na connection to AC power.\n\n\n\n\n\n\na common username across all operating systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional:\n\n\n\n\n\n\na USB mouse for right-clicking in Windows and Ubuntu while you're setting things up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nadditional disk space for a shared data partition\n\n\n\n\n\n\na printed copy of these instructions :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequired (but hopefully obvious) disclaimers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am not a computer expert. But I did stay at a Holiday Inn Express last night.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBACK UP ALL IMPORTANT DATA\n before proceeding!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstalling OS X\n\n\nCreate bootable OS X installer\n\n\nFind a USB stick or external hard drive with at least 8 GB capacity, and transfer any important data off of it as this procedure will erase the disk.\n\n\nFrom the App Store, download OS X El Capitain \nbut do not begin the installation process\n. In Finder, open Applications. You should see an app called \"Install OS X El Capitan.\" Insert your (bootable) USB stick or external hard drive and open Finder to determine the name of your external disk. If you prefer, you can also erase the disk using Disk Utility and simply select the default \"Untitled\" name. The command below assumes the disk is named \"Untitled\" but modify as needed. Open Terminal and type: (\nNOTE:\n this will erase the disk!):\n\n\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan.app --nointeraction\n\n\n\nand replace \n/Volumes/Untitled\n with the name of your external disk.\n\n\nInstall OS X (if not already installed)\n\n\nReboot the computer and, with your installer disk connected, hold down the Option key. You will see a menu with different boot options. Select the yellow icon labeled \"Install OS X El Capitan.\"\n\n\nWhen the installer loads, run Disk Utility. Select your internal hard drive and click \"erase.\" Give the disk a name, and select GUID partition table and OS X Extended (Journaled). When the command completes, quit Disk Utility.\n\n\nSelect \"Install OS X\" from the menu and select your hard disk (i.e. the one you just erased and reformatted) as the installation target. The system will reboot and eventually ask you for configuration/preferences. \nDO NOT transfer any files at this time.\n Do not enable FileVault encryption.\n\n\nInstall Windows 8.1\n\n\nA few other online tutorials for triple booting call for arresting the Windows Boot Camp installation process in order to install Ubuntu. None of them worked for me. I could only get Windows booting properly if I let Boot Camp run from start to finish, without interruption. Boot Camp requires that the destination hard drive have only one partition, and so Windows needs to be installed \nbefore\n Ubuntu. (This is a bit misleading, since an OS X-only partition actually has 3 partitions: the EFI system partition (ESP), the OS itself, and the OS X recovery partition. See for yourself: before proceeding, open a Terminal and type \ndiskutil list\n.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen Applications --> Utilities --> Boot Camp Assistant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect the \n.iso\n file you downloaded for Windows 8.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrag the slider to give \nonly as much disk space as you want for Windows\n. In my case, I left ~60 GB for Windows at the end of the disk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick continue. Boot Camp Assistant will download the required software and drivers, and will reboot automatically into the Windows 8.1 installer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow the prompts and select the option to customize the installation. You will then be shown a list of partitions. \nDO NOT\n add or remove any partitions. Click on the advanced options button, then select \nDisk 0 Partition 5: BOOTCAMP\n, and click Format. This will erase the Boot Camp partition that the Assistant created and reformat it as NTFS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect \nDisk 0 Partition 5: BOOTCAMP\n and click Next.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrab a cup of coffee while Windows finishes its installation. It will reboot several times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Windows installer will eventually bring up a Boot Camp dialog box. Click through the prompts to install drivers. When the Boot Camp installer finishes, click Reboot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should now have a stable dual-boot system, and (for the time being) there are two ways of selecting which OS you want to boot:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPress and hold the Option key on reboot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect the Startup Disk before you reboot. In OS X, go to System Preferences --> Startup Disk, and select BOOTCAMP. In Windows, search for 'boot camp' and open the Windows version of the same utility; it can also be accessed via Control Panel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore you proceed,\n make sure that you can safely reboot into both Windows and OS X.\n\n\nPrepare for Ubuntu Installation\n\n\nBy default, Apple does not allow existing partitions to be resized. This is because OS X occupies a \"Core Storage\" partition, which Google tells me no one really understands. Fortunately, this can be disabled.\n\n\nTo review, we now have OS X taking up the first 940 GB, with Windows 8.1 taking up the last 60 GB. We want to shrink the existing OS X partition without modifying anything else.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen a Terminal (Applications --> Utilities --> Terminal) and type:\n\n\ndiskutil cs list\n\n\n\nYou should see an output that looks something like this:\n\n\nCoreStorage logical volume groups (1 found)\n|\n+-- Logical Volume Group C2356C06-A89F-4334-AE29-D7390FB36A11\n    =========================================================\n    Name:         mac\n    Status:       Online\n    Size:         918372315136 B (918.4 GB)\n    Free Space:   18984960 B (19.0 MB)\n    |\n    +-< Physical Volume CB7CE669-6B7C-44C4-9EC3-71E9A6072BF3\n    |   ----------------------------------------------------\n    |   Index:    0\n    |   Disk:     disk0s2\n    |   Status:   Online\n    |   Size:     918372315136 B (918.4 GB)\n    |\n    +-> Logical Volume Family EA474DAB-C993-4A67-8DC8-18E4B1BF06E1\n        ----------------------------------------------------------\n        Encryption Type:         None\n        |\n        +-> Logical Volume B3ECE9A1-8E51-444B-9D46-9E470BC92BC4  <---- COPY THIS STRING\n            ---------------------------------------------------\n            Disk:                  disk1\n            Status:                Online\n            Size (Total):          918001008640 B (918.0 GB)\n            Revertible:            Yes (no decryption required)  <--- This must say 'yes'\n            LV Name:               mac\n            Volume Name:           mac\n            Content Hint:          Apple_HFS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should see a revertible logical volume. In a Terminal window type\n\n\ndiskutil cs revert B3ECE9A1-8E51-444B-9D46-9E470BC92BC4\n\n\n\nwhere \nB3ECE9A1-8E51-444B-9D46-9E470BC92BC4\n is the UUID for your logical volume.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReboot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReopen Terminal and type \ndiskutil list\n to show all of your current disks and partitions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType \ndiskutil cs list\n. The output should say\n\n\nNo CoreStorage logical volume groups found\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReboot again, but this time boot into Recovery Mode by holding down Command + R as the system boots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisable System Integrity Protection. This is required for installing GPT fdisk and rEFInd below. This is a security feature Apple introduced with El Capitan that protects certain low-level system directories, but fortunately this can be disabled. Within Recovery Mode, select Terminal from the Utilities pulldown menu and type\n\n\ncsrutil disable\nreboot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe computer should boot normally into OS X. Let's check our disk partitioning scheme again with \ndiskutil list\n:\n\n\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS mac                     938.4 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3\n   4:       Microsoft Basic Data BOOTCAMP                61.3 GB    disk0s4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake note of the identifier for your primary OS X partition, in this case \ndisk0s2\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Terminal type\n\n\ndiskutil resizeVolume /dev/disk0s2 80G\n\n\n\nand resize your OS X partition to whatever size you want.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall Ubuntu 14.04 LTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShut down the computer, disconnect all unnecessary peripherals, and insert a bootable USB Ubuntu installation disk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTurn on the computer. Immediately press and hold the Option key and wait for external devices to appear. Select your Ubuntu installation media.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect 'Try Ubuntu without installing'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the Ubuntu desktop appears, click the 'Install Ubuntu' desktop icon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow the prompts until the Installation Type dialog box appears. Select 'something else.'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will see a listing of existing partitions (and available free space) on \n/dev/sda\n. Create (at minimum) the following in the ~860 GB of available disk space:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16 GB swap area\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24 GB ext4-formatted space for the \n/\n partition (or whatever size you prefer)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe remaining free space as 'unformatted'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote the number of the \n/\n partition you just assigned. For me it was \n/dev/sda6\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the pulldown 'device for bootloader installation', select whatever you identified in step 7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Next to verify your configuration and Install Ubuntu. Restart when prompted. The computer \nshould\n reboot into OS X; if it does not, reboot again and hold down the Option key to select OS X.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepair the hybrid MBR created during Ubuntu installation\n\n\nRod Smith is an expert on this topic so I'll simply defer to his tools for tackling boot issues and inconsistencies across different hardware and operating systems.\n\n\nDespite telling Ubuntu to put its bootloader on its own partition, the installation screws with the Master Boot Record (MBR) such that Windows would no longer boot for me, even after verifying above that it could. Ubuntu creates an unstable hybrid MBR that needs to be restored to a more stable protective MBR.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload and install \nGPT fdisk\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Terminal, type\n\n\nsudo gdisk /dev/disk0\n\n\n\nwhich should show the MBR as hybrid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen type the following, pressing Enter after each letter:\n\n\np  (to print the current MBR configuration)\nx  (to enter expert mode)\nn  (to create a new protective MBR)\nw  (to write the new configuration)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\n\n\nsudo gdisk /dev/disk0\n\n\n\nagain and now the MBR should be listed as protective.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall rEFInd\n\n\nrEFInd is another awesome tool from Rod Smith that streamlines the multi-boot configuration, providing a handy list of options at startup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload \nrEFInd\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssuming OS X automatically unzips the file, open Terminal and type\n\n\ncd ~/Downloads/refind-bin-0.10.3\nsudo ./refind-install\n\n\n\nThat's it! Try rebooting and you should see something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerify that you can boot into each OS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a shared data partition (optional)\n\n\nThe original intent of this procedure was to configure a MacBook Pro for DNA sequencing using the Oxford Nanopore \nMinION\n. Its MinKNOW software runs best on Windows, but most bioinformatics tools are *NIX-based. I wanted a completely portable system that enabled remote data acquisition and analysis via a shared data partition comprising the bulk of the 1-TB PCIe hard drive. Ideally this partition should be readable and writable from all 3 operating systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn OS X, open Disk Utility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect the hard drive, and click Partition. \nDO NOT erase or modify any of the existing OS partitions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on the pie slice corresponding to the large chunk of unformatted space in the middle of the disk left after installing Ubuntu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGive that slice a name (e.g. DATA) and select FAT as the file system. Click OK. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a Terminal type\n\n\ndiskutil list\n\n\n\nto see the hard disk configuration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake the new DATA partition play nice with Ubuntu\n\n\nRather than your username, your UID is more important for establishing compatibility of files and permissions between OS X and Ubuntu. By default, your UID in OS X is 501, but in Ubuntu, your default UID is 1001. Fortunately, this can be changed:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoot into Ubuntu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn System Preferences, create a temporary user account with administrator privileges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a terminal, type\n\n\nsudo passwd temp\n\n\n\nwhere \ntemp\n is the temporary username you just created. Enter a temporary password - it doesn't matter what it is, because you'll soon delete this user.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a terminal, type\n\n\nsudo gedit /etc/login.defs\n\n\n\nlook for the line (Ctrl + F works) containing \nUID_MIN\n and change its value to 500. Save changes and quit Gedit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReboot back into Ubuntu. \nLog in as the temporary user you just created.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen a terminal window and type\n\n\nsudo usermod -u 501 username\n\n\n\nwhere \nusername\n is your primary username.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReboot back into Ubuntu and login as your primary username.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a terminal window type\n\n\nid -u username\n\n\n\nwhere \nusername\n is your primary username. Verify that your UID has been changed to 501.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn System Preferences, delete the temporary user account you created in Step 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOdds and Ends\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe FAT-formatted \nDATA\n partition you created should auto-mount in Ubuntu at \n/media/username/DATA\n. Try making a short plain text file and save it to that partition. Then reboot into OS X and add another line to the file. Then boot into Windows and verify that the file is readable and writeable across each OS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have each OS up and running, \ninstall any recommended OS updates\n and configure each OS as you wish. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nShameless plug: I have a detailed guide \nhere\n for getting OS X set up for bioinformatics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf duplicate boot menu options are bugging you, you can customize your rEFInd configuration. Details \nhere\n.",

Disable System Integrity Protection. This is required for installing GPT fdisk and rEFInd below.

Ubuntu creates an unstable hybrid MBR that needs to be restored to a more stable protective MBR.    Download and install  GPT fdisk .    In Terminal, type  sudo gdisk /dev/disk0  which should show the MBR as hybrid.
